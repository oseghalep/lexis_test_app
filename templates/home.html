            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Insurance works by providing financial protection against unexpected events or losses. Here's a simplified overview of how insurance operates:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Policy Creation: You select the type of insurance coverage you need and purchase a policy from an insurance provider like Insurance Company.</li>
                <li>Premium Payments: You pay regular premiums to the insurance company. The amount of the premium depends on various factors, such as the level of coverage, your risk profile, and the duration of the policy.</li>
                <li>Claims Process: If an insured event occurs, such as a car accident or damage to your property, you can file a claim with your insurance company. The company will assess the claim and, if approved, provide compensation or cover the costs up to the policy limits.</li>
                <li>Policy Renewal: Insurance policies typically have a specific term. At the end of the term, you can renew the policy by paying the required premium for another term or make any necessary adjustments to the coverage.</li>
                <li>Peace of Mind: Insurance offers you peace of mind, knowing that you have financial protection in case of unforeseen events. It helps mitigate risks and provides a safety net for you and your loved ones.</li>
            </ol>
